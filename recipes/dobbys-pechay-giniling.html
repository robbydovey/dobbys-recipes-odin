        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A recipe that is most beloved in the Bat-og-Angeles household. This has been a frequently-cooked dish as it evokes memories from Dobby's elementary days, when he first made this dish from home-grown Pechay plants </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3-4 bundles of Pechay plants</li>
            <li>1/4kg ground pork</li>
            <li>1 piece red onion</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>Maggi Magic Sarap</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the ingredients for stir-fry by mincing the onions and garlic. Slice the Pechay plants crosswise to create the noodly shape of the leaves.</li>
            <li>Sautee the minced garlic and onions.</li>
            <li>Once the garlic is golden brown, add the ground pork. Stir-fry until the ground pork is cooked (white-golden brown appearance.)</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce and stir-fry until the soy sauce has seeped into the meat.</li>
            <li>Add water until meat is submerged. Add salt, pepper, and Magic Sarap to taste.</li>
            <li>Once preferred taste has been achieved, add the sliced Pechay leaves.</li>
            <li>Let dish boil until the Pechay leaves are cooked. Adjust by adding salt or pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
