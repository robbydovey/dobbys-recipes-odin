        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A recipe invented by Doverto the Great whilst in Bislig. Languishing on all the bay-side fish dishes, this dish was made to have an alternative meat dish with minimal sneaking when buying cookstuff from the wet market</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4kg of minced pork</li>
            <li>1 piece red onion</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>6 pieces of calamansi</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Cooking oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Ground pepper</li>
            <li>Maggi Magic Sarap</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the ingredients by mincing the pork(if not minced yet), garlic, and onions. Slice the calamansi.</li>
            <li>Make a marinate by pouring soy sauce in a decently-sized bowl. Insert half of the minced garlic and onions. Squeeze the calamansi into the bowl through a fork or a colander to filter out the seeds. Add salt and pepper to your liking. Add Magic Sarap to your liking. Mix well, then add minced pork into the bowl. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cooking oil to a pan. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, sautee the other half of the garlic and onions in the pan 'til the garlic is golden brown. Pour the marinate mix and minced pork into the pan.</li>
            <li>Stir-fry the dish and let the water content evaporate. When you can see that the meat has absorbed the sauce, and only the oil remains, turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Your dish is now ready to eat. Preferably, with white rice, and fried eggplants.</li>
